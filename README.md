# MessageManager
**Simple yet customizable MessageManager Plugin**

This is a basic plugin for handling messages, it supports player death by another player or mob, staff chat, broadcasting and player leaving/joining

Support for /msg, /r and other commands will be available in future. This plugin is nowhere near finished, got ideas? let me know!

### Commands

> /sc [msg] | /staffchat [msg] | @[msg] - Send a message into StaffChat (You can use @ at the beginning of your message to auto-send to staff chat too)

> /sctoggle | /staffchattoggle - Toggle auto-sending your messages to the staff chat

> /scview | /staffchatview - Being able to see staff chat messages (helpful if streaming etc)

> /bc [msg] | /broadcast [msg] - Broadcast a message to the entire server

### Permissions

>/sc | /staffchat - messagemanager.staffchat

>/sctoggle | /staffchattoggle - messagemanager.staffchat

>/scview | /staffchatview - messagemanager.staffchat

>/bc | /broadcast - messagemanager.broadcast

### How to install
Simply just drag & drop the plugin into your plugins folder. Use the permissions at the top of **config.yml** to give your players the correct permissions.

Don't have a permissions plugin? I recommend [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net).
